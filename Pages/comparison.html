<h1> Pros and Cons of "The Walking Dead: The Final Season"</h1>
<p>The Walking Dead is a video game series developed by Telltale. 
    It is a decisions based game, were all your decisions are important to the plot of the story.
    Throughout the series, it has been based on the main character Clementine, who goes through drastic changes it the earth's environment. And where she has to make harsh decisions to survive from the break out of zombies.
    For the past few months, there has been lots of controversy over the game, since Telltale has gone out of business.
    But just recently the game has been picked back up by another gaming company, Skybound Games.
    The first release was on April 24, 2012. </p>

<header>What I Like About The Final Season</header>
<section>There are many things that I like about The Walking Dead. One of those things is their graphics. 
   They have always been really good, they have a comic book feel to them. Another thing I like is when Skybound took over, 
   a lot more action was happening. It always left you on edge, that's what I love in a video game. </section>

<header>What I Dislike About The Final Season</header>
<section>Most of my dislike comes from when Telltale was producing The Walking Dead. All of the storylines were pretty boring,
    There were only a few times when others died is when it got interesting. There was not a lot of adrenalin flowing through 
    your veins like it was when Skybound took over. It was just a lot of shock value. Another reason why I disliked this season was that they made you force AJ to kill other people when Clementine could have done it. 
    She is the "adult" in this season and them forcing you to kill off a character when they did something wrong to the tribe.</section>
