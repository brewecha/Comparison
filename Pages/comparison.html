<h1> Pros and Cons of "The Walking Dead: The Final Season"</h1>
<p>The Walking Dead is a video game series developed by telltale. 
    It is a desisions based game, were all your decisions are important to the plot of the story.
    Throughout the series it has been based off of the main character Clementine, who goes through 
    drastic changes it the earths environment. And were she has to make harsh decisions to sirvive from the break out of zombies.
    For the past few months there has been lots of contriversy over the game, since Telltale has gone out of business.
    But just recentaly the game has been picked back up by another gaming company, Skybound Games.
    The first release was on April 24, 2012.  </p>

<header>What I Dislike About The Final Season</header>
<article>Most of my dislike comes from when telltale was preducing The Walking Dead. All of the story line was pretty boring,
    There were only a few times when others died is when it got interesting. There was not a lot of edrinalin flowing through your vains 
    like it was when Skybound took over. It was just a lot of shock value. Another reason why I disliked this season was because they 
    made you force AJ to kill other people, when Clementine could have done it. 
    She is the "adult" in this season and them forcing you to kill off a character when they did something wrong to the tribe</article>
