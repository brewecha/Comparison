<p>The Walking Dead is a video game series developed by telltale. 
    It is a desisions based game, were all your decisions are important to the plot of the story.
    Throughout the series it has been based off of the main character Clementine, who goes through 
    drastic changes it the earths environment. And were she has to make harsh decisions to sirvive from the break out of zombies.
